# attn

**Under development.**

The goal is to visualize **attention head** scores. This project provides utilities to compute per-head, token-to-token attention across layers (see `attn_scores.py`) and aims to expose them via a visualization interface.

## Run

Python 3.10 recommended.

```bash
python app.py
```
